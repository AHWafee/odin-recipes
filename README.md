I thinhk i have learnt a thing or two about git and github, how to use them,
how to manage my files with them.
I also have learnt basic HTML.
Some of the tags that I have learnt are :
html, head, body, meta, emp, strong, h1, h2, h3, title, ol, ul, li, img, a.
I hope i will continue to learn more and more things.
